**Kingfisher Debt Bird**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kingfisher Debt Bird is a tongue-in-cheek remake of the classic Flappy Bird game, where instead of guiding a bird through pipes, you pilot the Kingfisher Airlines plane through financial obstacles. The score starts at the infamous debt amount the airline was once associated with, and every successful pass reduces the "debt".

The intent of this project was purely for fun. I built it in a short burst of free time during college when I was bored and wanted to make something lighthearted. It’s not meant to be taken seriously, but it does showcase how quickly a functional and entertaining web game can be put together.


**Tech Stack**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• HTML5 Canvas for rendering the game

• CSS for styling and creating a polished, responsive look

• Vanilla JavaScript for game logic, animations, event handling, physics, collision detection, scoring, and controls

**Features**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• Debt-based scoring system instead of starting from zero

• Pixel-art style with smooth animations

• Restart button with witty, debt-themed messages

• Responsive gameplay that works across different screen sizes

**Disclaimer**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a non-commercial, satirical project made for entertainment and learning purposes. Any references to real companies or figures are purely fictional and humorous.


**Intent**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• To create something humorous and absurd while still being technically functional.

• To use a real-world pop culture reference (Kingfisher’s downfall) in a lighthearted way.

• To practice rapid prototyping and game logic design without overthinking.


**How It Works**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Load the game in your browser

• Press Space, Arrow Up, or X to make the plane jump

• Avoid hitting the Vijay Mallya mansion 

• Watch your score go down as you “repay” the fictional debt

• Crash, laugh at the witty restart message, and try again


**Why This Exists**:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This isn’t a startup idea or a monetized product. It’s a silly, quick project that shows how even a non-serious idea can be turned into something playable in just a few hours.
Sometimes, building without pressure or expectations leads to the most fun results.
