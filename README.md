Kingfisher Debt Bird
Kingfisher Debt Bird is a tongue-in-cheek remake of the classic Flappy Bird game, where instead of guiding a bird through pipes, you pilot the Kingfisher Airlines plane through financial obstacles. The score starts at the infamous debt amount the airline was once associated with, and every successful pass reduces the "debt".

The intent of this project was purely for fun. I built it in a short burst of free time during college when I was bored and wanted to make something lighthearted. It’s not meant to be taken seriously, but it does showcase how quickly a functional and entertaining web game can be put together.

Kingfisher Debt Bird
Kingfisher Debt Bird is a satirical, college-built twist on the classic Flappy Bird game.
Instead of flapping a bird through pipes, you fly a Kingfisher Airlines plane through obstacles while battling a debt counter that starts in the billions. The more you survive, the more debt you “pay off.”

The goal was never to create a serious game but to experiment with HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript game loops, and event-driven mechanics in a short burst of creativity. I made this in a single afternoon during college when I was bored between classes, fueled by coffee and the urge to build something ridiculous but playable.

Intent
To create something humorous and absurd while still being technically functional.

To use a real-world pop culture reference (Kingfisher’s downfall) in a lighthearted way.

To practice rapid prototyping and game logic design without overthinking.

Tech Stack
HTML5 Canvas for rendering the visuals and animations

Vanilla JavaScript for physics, collision detection, scoring, and controls

CSS for styling, layout, and making the UI feel polished and intentional

Key Features
Debt starts at the historic Kingfisher Airlines debt figure instead of zero

Pixel-art, retro-inspired visual style

Smooth gravity and jump physics for satisfying gameplay

Restart button with witty debt-themed messages after each crash

Responsive layout so it can run on both desktop and mobile

How It Works
Load the game in your browser

Press Space, Arrow Up, or X to make the plane jump

Avoid hitting the pipes

Watch your score go down as you “repay” the fictional debt

Crash, laugh at the witty restart message, and try again

Why This Exists
This isn’t a startup idea or a monetized product. It’s a silly, quick project that shows how even a non-serious idea can be turned into something playable in just a few hours.
Sometimes, building without pressure or expectations leads to the most fun results.
